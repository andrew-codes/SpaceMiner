# Getting Started

## Quick Start

Ensure you have the following software installed:

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
3. `git clone git@github.com:andrew-codes/SpaceMiner.git` to clone repository
4. `cd SpaceMiner` to change directory into root of project
6. `docker-compose -f stack.dev.yml up` and visit [http://localhost](http://localhost)
    - Windows users: environment variable, `COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS` must be set to `1`. Example in git bash on Windows: `COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1 docker-compose -f stack.dev.yml up`
1. (optional) API is located at [http://api.localhost](http://api.localhost)
2. (optional) Database admin tool located at  [http://dba.localhost](http://dba.localhost)
    - use connection string (mongodb://root:example@mongodb or mongodb://mongodb)

> NOTE: port 80 is the default port SpaceMiner runs on in development. However, in case this port is not available, a `PORT` environment variable enables running on a different port; example: `PORT=3000 docker-compose -f stack.dev.yml up`.

See [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting-guide.md) for help with issues.

## Developing Locally

It is recommended to use the above configuration to run locally as it also includes mongo without needing to install/configure it lcoally. However, in order to manage or add new dependencies to packages, follow these steps:

1. Install [node@^8.11.1](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [yarn@^1.3.0](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
3. `cd SpaceMinder` and then from CLI these tasks can be run
4. `yarn && yarn bootstrap` to install/initialize dependencies in project
5. (Optional) `yarn lint` will lint all source files
6. (Optional) `yarn test` will run all tests

## Managing Dependencies

Packages are managed using [lerna](https://lernajs.io/). Each package has its own list of dependencies. Therefore, dependencies are not added at the project root level; rather scoped to a specific package. There are `yarn` scripts to help automate this:

> **Note**: If you run into trouble after installing a new dependency, try running `yarn && yarn bootstrap`.

- **Adding** a new dependency, use `yarn lerna add --scope @space-miner/package-name dependency-name`
- For **dev dependencies**, add the `--dev` CLI option `yarn lerna add --dev --scope @space-miner/package-name dependency-name`
- **Removing** dependencies requires deleting the item from the package's `package.json` and re-running `yarn && yarn bootstrap` in the project root.
